### Creation Information

As the Target and Body may be created at a different time, and by a different agent, from the one that created the Annotation, creation information can be associated with the Body or Target resources body. 

`dcterms:creator` denotes the the agent responsible for creating the Body or Target. This may be either a human or software agent. There MAY be 1 or more `dcterms:creator` relationships. Creators SHOULD be described as a `foaf:Agent` (sub)class and its properties.

`dcterms:created` denotes the time at which the Body or Target was created. There MAY be exactly 1 `dcterms:created` property, and MUST NOT be more than 1. The datetime MUST be expressed in the xsd:dateTime format, and SHOULD have a timezone specified.

### Classes

It is useful for clients to know the general type of a Web Resource in advance. E.g. if the client cannot render videos, then knowing that the Body is a video will allow it to avoid needlessly downloading a potentially large content stream. 

Possible classes for typing a target includes `dcmi:Dataset`, `dcmi:Image`, `dcmi:Video`, `dcmi:Sound` and `dcmi:Text`."""@en ;
